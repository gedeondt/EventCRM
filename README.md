# EventCRM

This project explores building a CRM using **Event Sourcing** in Node.js. The codebase follows a _feature-oriented_ approach with **vertical slices**, meaning each feature lives in its own directory with the commands, events and HTTP routes that belong to it.

## Goals

- Model CRM entities (for now contacts) as aggregates whose changes are represented by immutable events.
- Allow the system to grow by adding new slices without affecting the rest of the code.
- Provide traceability for every operation through a `TraceContext` carried inside the events.

## Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€ server.ts          # Express service entrypoint
â”œâ”€ shared/            # Common utilities (event-store, trace)
â””â”€ slices/
   â””â”€ contact/
      â”œâ”€ create-contact/
      â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts   # Command + event
      â”‚  â””â”€ http.ts    # REST endpoint for creation
      â”œâ”€ edit-contact/
      â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts
      â”‚  â””â”€ http.ts    # Endpoint for editing
      â””â”€ project-contact/
         â”œâ”€ index.ts   # Projection logic
         â””â”€ http.ts    # Endpoint for fetching
```

- **server.ts** registers each slice as an Express router.
- Inside `slices/` every file implements part of the command and event flow.

## Event Store

Events are persisted in **DynamoDB**. The helper `appendEvent` controls the aggregate version and verifies that no `undefined` values are present before writing:

```ts
import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import {
  DynamoDBDocumentClient,
  PutCommand
} from '@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb';

// ...
export async function appendEvent(event: any, aggregateId: string, version: number) {
  const item = {
    PK: `contact#${aggregateId}`,
    SK: `v${String(version).padStart(10, '0')}`,
    ...event
  };
  // Validation and write to DynamoDB
}
```

_Infrastructure:_ the `infra/` folder contains Terraform definitions that create the `EventStore` table with streams enabled for future event subscriptions.

## Contact slice

The first slice implemented handles creating and editing contacts. Each command produces an event (`ContactCreated` or `ContactEdited`) that is then stored using `appendEvent`. Each operation now has its own folder with a dedicated `http.ts` file:

```ts
// ðŸ“Œ POST /contacts â†’ Create contact
router.post('/contacts', async (req, res) => { /* ... */ });

// ðŸ“Œ PUT /contacts/:id â†’ Edit contact
router.put('/contacts/:id', async (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
```

## Running

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and exposes its endpoints under `/api`.

## Next steps

- Add new slices (for example, managing opportunities or tasks).
- Implement event projections and queries.
- Automate fetching and checking aggregate versions.
